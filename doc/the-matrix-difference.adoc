* a property can be expressed as a function of other properties;
* other properties can be designated as "inputs". These can be mutated destructivley to introduce external state to the system, such as API future results and XHR responses.
* finally, a property can be specified as any HLL literal value, and then be treated as a const. FMX will throw a reminder exception if one attempts to change that property;
* different instances can have different formulas for the same property;
* FXM instances are like prototypes: any given instance can be created with new/ad hoc properties.
